# Uk.Org.Adcock.Parallel

A lightweight implementation of a small subset of Microsoft's Parallel Extensions for .Net 3.5/4.0 that can be used with the earlier .Net/C# 2.0

This is an analogue of "Microsoft Parallel Extensions to .NET Framework 3.5, June 2008 Community Technology Preview" from: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=348f73fd-593d-4b3c-b055-694c50d2b0f3&amp;DisplayLang=en It is not a full implementation, and should be deprecated by a switch to Visual Studio 2010/.Net 4.0 by using the Microsoft/Novell Mono equivalents. Mono already supports the Parallel Extensions.

This class supports the Parallel.For and Parallel.ForEach loop constructs.

This should work on any version of C#/.Net that supports generics.
